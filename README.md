# capstone_project

Project Overview:
Design complete solution to demonstrate end-to-end pipeline development and manage a machine/deep learning project
Develop an understanding of all stages of a machine learning project life-cycle
Demonstrate understanding of challenges encountered during the project development and provide ways to tackle them
Showcase understanding of software engineering best practices while developing the project

Problem Statement:
Classify News Articles into categories - With information overload today users are inundated with news articles of all topics, even the ones which may not be relevant to users. Design a system which can classify incoming news articles and appropriately tag the corresponding category. Develop a data pipeline which includes the all the following stages of Machine Learning Project Life Cycle â€“ 
1.Data Ingestion
2.Data Preparation
3.Data segregation & Model Training
4.Model Deployment
5.Model Prediction

Project Milestones:
